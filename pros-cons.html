                <p>Any usable energy produced by water, whether it originates from turbines, dams, or some other source,
                    is known as hydropower. Hydropower, like all energy sources, whether renewable or not, has
                    advantages and disadvantages. We'll go through some of the main advantages and disadvantages of
                    hydropower technology.

                <p class="bold">1. The use of hydropower is clean and renewable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Water is a clean energy source, unlike conventional fossil fuels, which discharge hazardous
                    pollutants into the air and water. Additionally, since hydroelectric facilities don't consume water
                    while they are in operation, hydropower is a completely renewable source of electricity. Hydropower
                    will always be a practical option to produce electricity because of how the water cycle operates
                    naturally.

                    2. Irrigation can be powered by hydropower.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    In addition to producing energy, hydropower plants have the significant advantage of being able to
                    supply a source of irrigation for nearby crops. Hydropower reservoirs can be used as a safe and
                    dependable source of freshwater, particularly in regions where rain is infrequent and droughts are
                    frequent.

                    3. In the long term, hydropower is affordable.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    Although hydropower has large upfront expenditures, it has been found to be one of the most
                    affordable sources of renewable energy over time. Once the necessary infrastructure has been built,
                    hydropower requires less upkeep than other energy sources, and modifications are being made to
                    enhance its performance.

                    1. It Has an Effect on the Environment
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>

                    The potential negative effects of hydroelectric electricity on the environment may be its biggest
                    drawback. Water flow obstructions can also have a significant impact on fish migration, particularly
                    for species like salmon that depend on rivers for spawning. Even the biological signals that
                    instruct fish where to go when it's time to migrate might be impacted by dams.

                    2.There are dry spells.
                </p><br>
                <p>

                    Water may and does experience cycles of excess and scarcity, which should be considered while
                    assessing the benefits and drawbacks of hydroelectric power. The production of energy can be
                    significantly impacted by lower-than-normal water levels, which is a drawback of hydroelectric
                    power.
                </p><br>
                <p>

                    Hydro energy production can contribute to drought conditions downstream if it doesn't allow enough
                    water to get through, in addition to being affected by drought.

                <p>

                    Dams still pose risks notwithstanding the absence of combustible fuel. Both dam failure and
                    construction mishaps have the potential to cause harm or even fatalities.
